# RedButton
An Arduino and Python driven project for locking/timing/etc with a red button. Who doesn't like red buttons?

# Usage
Upload the .ino script to your arduino. Normally, it will send [Ctrl]-[Alt]-l to lock the computer.

When starting the python script, it will connect to the arduino over serial connection, enabling the 'timing mode'. Then, the button sends [Enter], and the time between the presses will be shown in the python script.
